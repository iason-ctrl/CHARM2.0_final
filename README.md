CHARM2.0: Cosmic History Agnostic Reconstruction Method
=================
Reconstructing cosmic expansion history (cosmic energy density as a function of redshift) 
without assuming a specific type of matter distribution in the Universe. Data are distance moduli and
redshifts from Supernovae Ia from the 
[Union2.1](https://supernova.lbl.gov/Union/) compilation and [Pantheon+](https://pantheonplussh0es.github.io) Analysis.

Powered by [NIFTy](https://ift.pages.mpcdf.de/nifty/user/installation.html) (v8). 

Is an update of [CHARM](https://gitlab.mpcdf.mpg.de/natalia/charm) by [Natalia Porqueres et al. 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04007) in which geoVI is used instead of an iterative MAP approach.


Requirements
=================
*   NIFTy can be installed using pip:

        pip install nifty8
* If necessary, after NIFTy installation: Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, pickle, matplotlib, seaborn 





standard mean and fluct and std are only valid if length is so and so and resolution

Usage and Workflow
=================
Copy onto your local device.

Pickles WILL be overwritten if their name is not changed manually (if you want e.g. to play 
around with cf parameters.)
Explain how to deploy this project. Maybe minimum computer specifications or browser requirements are listed here as well.
