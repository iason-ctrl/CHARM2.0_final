CHARM2.0: Cosmic History Agnostic Reconstruction Method
=================
Reconstructing cosmic expansion history (cosmic energy density as a function of redshift) 
without assuming a specific type of matter distribution in the Universe. Data are distance moduli and
redshifts from Supernovae Ia from the 
[Union2.1](https://supernova.lbl.gov/Union/) compilation and [Pantheon+](https://pantheonplussh0es.github.io) Analysis.

Powered by [NIFTy](https://ift.pages.mpcdf.de/nifty/user/installation.html) (v8). 

Is an update of [CHARM](https://gitlab.mpcdf.mpg.de/natalia/charm) by [Natalia Porqueres et al. 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04007) in which geoVI is used instead of an iterative MAP approach.
